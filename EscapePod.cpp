Someone has thoughtfully placed a bottle of vodka with a glass next to the chair, likely a soldier was using the pod as a room for some private drinking.  You look to the right and see a porthole that shows the vast expanse of space.  You can see a planet surrounded by four moons far away, otherwise itâ€™s a black blanket dotted with distant stars.  You breathe a sigh of relief, sit in the chair and press the button to activate the escape pod.  You sip at the vodka as you watch the spaceship slowly get smaller out of the porthole. \n";
