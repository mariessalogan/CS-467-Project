You start listening to track 1 of \“Kirk’s Spoken Word Smooth Jazz\”: ♪♪You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? You calling me has been? What'd you say your name is? ♪♪ You can’t stand it any more and hit the stop button.\n
You play track 2...♪♪I want to live like common people, I want to do whatever common people do, I want to sleep with common people, I want to sleep with common people, Like you.♪♪ Your eyes roll so hard that you almost pass out. You hit the stop button before you succumb to harakiri.\n
