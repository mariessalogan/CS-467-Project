Hallway
You start walking down the hallway and you see phaser burns on both walls.  A sparking light fixture dangles in the middle of the hallway, casting light on the horrific scene below.  You see the open eyes of Starbuck reflecting the light as she lays prostrate on the ground. Next to her is the crumpled form of Mal. Both of their phasers are destroyed, on the ground.
Starbuck and Mal lie dead on the floor of the hallway, they went out fighting.
