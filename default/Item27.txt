You approach the body and realize that it’s Captain Kirk. You roll him over and a recorder falls out of his outstretched hand and hits the ground, causing it to start playing.  \“Hello.. I have tried to enter the command center to get to the last escape pod.. The alien is in the command center, guarding the last escape.  If only I had remembered to grab my armor and a phaser. I can’t even see where he is, he is cloaked in some sort of invisibility aura.  I am recording this in case I do not make it. I will try to fix the transporter to escape to a nearby planet and hope that I can find some… AAAHHHGHGHGHHHHHHH\” The communicator shuts off suddenly, and you realize you just heard the last few moments of the Captain.  You look towards the doors of the command center and wonder if you have the appropriate tools to defeat the alien guarding your only escape.
