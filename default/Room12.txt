command center
The room is brightly lit, there is even a spotlight on the captain’s chair, situated at the center of the room, so he can swivel and keep an eye on all of the crew members as they busy themselves around the command center.  At the nose of the ship, or the front corner of the command center room you see the pilot’s console.  There are the dinosaurs that Wash loved to play with while he flew the ship.  Wash was not the most professional, but he could fly the ship like a leaf on the wind.  You look at Lieutenant Uhura’s desk and see a message flashing, but you are unable to read it from the door.  You can see the door to the last escape pod on the ship, all others have been deployed but there is one left. Your salvation. 
You see the captain’s chair and the pilot’s console.  The console is covered in dinosaurs, and you can see the glistening door of the escape pod, your escape off of this god forsaken ship.
