mech suit
The suit is about 8 feet tall.  It is made from bright yellow metal and is used for loading/unloading goods, but has been used in fights before.  It can double as a suit of armor and a way to overpower a large enemy in a pinch.  Currently itâ€™s hanging from a crane, there are phaser blast marks all over it.  It must not have been fixed after the last skirmish.  Was it laziness or was it too damaged to fix?\n
