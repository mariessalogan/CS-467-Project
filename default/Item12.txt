bar
You groan with jealousy as you look at the bar that the Captain has had access to this whole time.  There are liquors that you couldn’t afford back on terra firma.  It’s all lit from behind in a soft blue light.  You pick up a bottle of scotch to look at it closer and suddenly smooth jazz starts playing and the lights lower.  You feel grossed out and put the liquor back.\n
