uniform
The uniforms come in different colors.  The uniform that your rank wears is a gold color.  There are red and blue colors for the other sectors of the military.  You scoff at the red shirts, neatly pressed and folded on the left, youâ€™re glad you never had to be a part of that sector, it was a joke and had the highest turnover.
