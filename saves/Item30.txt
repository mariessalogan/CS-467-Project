melvin
Melvin was shot in the back with a phaser and has a look of surprise on his face. His hair is disheveled and mussed and his uniform is unbuttoned at the top, which is unusual for the quartermaster. He usually was very well put together. Though you realize that he must have been trying to find alone time with the scientist Kelvin. He didnâ€™t even see his attacker coming.
Melvin is dead.
