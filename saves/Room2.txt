break room
You enter the break room and see an abandoned poker game at the communal table.  The chips are scattered across the floor.  From the other side of the ragged sofa you can see a hand poking around the floor.  As you get closer, you realize itâ€™s Lopez.  He has a surprised look frozen on his bloodless face, and a phaser wound in his chest. You feel for a pulse, knowing what the answer will be already. No pulse.  You see a Phaser clenched in his hand, the charge clip is completely empty. What happened here? There was obviously an attack, but how did you survive? These are all questions you can answer after you find an escape pod and get to safety. 
Lopez is on the ground, he was killed trying to defend himself.
