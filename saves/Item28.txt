transporter
You look at the transporterâ€™s console. It looks like a large claw or blade slashed it down the middle. Whoever destroyed it wanted to make sure that it was useless to any one trying to escape.  Every once in a while sparks emit from the console. You look at the glass and wonder what could have shattered the tube. It was extremely thick glass, any glass that was thin or had flaws would have immediately broken under the pressure of its first transport.
