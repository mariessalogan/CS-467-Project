captain's quarters
In the corner is a king sized bed, draped in red velour.  Next to it is a nightstand with a COMMUNICATOR flashing. A blue lit bar sits across from it, two scotch glasses sit on a tray.  You notice a cd player, with a cd case next to it.  You read the title “Kirk’s Spoken Word Smooth Jazz”. Your eyes immediately roll.  There is a door on the other side of the room with a security badge reader. It’s the captain’s bathroom. He had the lock installed after several pranks left his bathroom unusable. He did not appreciate having to share the locker rooms with the rest of the staff.
There is a fully stocked bar.  A communicator that you can pick up. If you want to torture yourself, you can listen to the captain’s spoken word, smooth jazz cd. There is also the captain’s bathroom, which needs his badge to enter.
